# Dylan's PufferPanel Templates
Various templates that I might decide to make and update for PufferPanel.

These are very heavily community-made and unofficial, if you need any help with what I make please make an issue here. Don't bother anyone else, lol.

I also don't promise the best of support (I'm still new to using and making PufferPanel templates), I'm making these because I needed them or because I was bored. If there's any issues you find feel free to contact me on here a GitHub Issue or Discord and I'll do my best to help you :)
